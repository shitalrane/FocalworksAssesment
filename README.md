Write a function to calculate a score for a candidate’s response for an essay type question based on how
closely it matches the correct answer.  
Assume that the function takes two string arguments:    
* Candidate’s response (Response)
* Correct Answer (CorrectAnswer)  

The function needs to identify each word in the Candidate’s response that matches with a word in the Correct
Answer and assign points based on the following rule:  
* Numbers - 4 points  
* Words with more than 7 characters - 3 points  
* Words with less than 5 characters - 0 points  
* All other words - 1 point  
  
Calculate “Maximum Possible Score” as Sum of points for each word in the Correct Response String  
Calculate “Points Scored” as Sum of points for each word in the “Candidate Response” that has a match with
a word in the Correct Answer string.  
After calculating both “Maximum Possible Score” and “Points Scored”, the function should return the
percentage ratio of the “Points Score” and the “Maximum Possible Score”
